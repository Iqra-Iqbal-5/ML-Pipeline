# ML-Pipeline
This project provides an interactive platform for managing machine learning workflows from data exploration to model evaluation. It allows users to easily load and explore datasets by uploading CSV files and visualizing data through various charts and graphs. The notebook supports data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. Users can select and train different machine learning models, perform cross-validation, and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance. Additionally, it provides tools for evaluating model accuracy and making predictions on new data, making it a comprehensive solution for end-to-end machine learning tasks.
